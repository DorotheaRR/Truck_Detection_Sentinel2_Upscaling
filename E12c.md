## Regional motorway truck traffic

prepared by Henrik Fisser within the [COVID-19 Custom Script Contest](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/contest-covid/) of ESA/EuroDataCube.

This indicator depicts the number of trucks moving on motorways in the EU. It is based on data from the [Copernicus Sentinel-2](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2) satellite.

### Truck traffic as economic indicator
Transportation on roads is by far the [most important mode of cargo logistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Freight_transport_statistics_-_modal_split) in Europe. The amount of roaming trucks may indicate how the economy of a country is performing. Germany for instance uses truck counts from toll statistics as a [short-term economic indicator](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXDAT/Datensaetze/truck-toll-mileage.html). Due to the COVID-19-combatting measures the European economy will contract in 2020 by approximately 9 % [according to the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-performance-and-forecasts/economic-forecasts/summer-2020-economic-forecast-deeper-recession-wider-divergences_en). Sentinel-2 data may be used for capturing some of these economic dynamics through the EU-wide truck detection.
The truck indicator suggests if there has been an unnormal low or high number of trucks on motorways within the respective region of interest. The considered period is 1. April to mid of June. Detected trucks of 2020 are compared with the median value of the baseline years 2017, 2018 and 2019. In each period the number of detected trucks in an area is divided by the number of observations. The counts of each year is compared with the baseline value, which is the median of the three baseline years. Truck counts higher or lower 5 % than the baseline will be denoted as 'High' or 'Low' respectively.

### Truck detection
This indicator is based on a new method that enables to detect trucks in Sentinel-2 data on a large scale. The method exploits an effect related to the [Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI)](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument) geometry: Sentinel-2 does not see a moving truck once but three times in the red-blue-green spectrum. As the truck is moving during this short time offset, it appears spectrally disassembled. This pattern may be used for detecting moving trucks on roads. In order to reduce false detections the computation is constrained to road data from [Open Street Maps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) (OSM).

### Overall results
In average 15 % less trucks were observed on motorways in the European Union during the considered period. However, the figures vary across the EU as depicted in Fig. 2. The picture might 

Given this diverse picture it is worth to explore the indicator in detail.

## Validation
The Sentinel-2 truck detection method was validated with [German traffic count stations](https://www.bast.de/BASt_2017/DE/Verkehrstechnik/Fachthemen/v2-verkehrszaehlung/zaehl_node.html) on the two motorways A3 and A61. This validation implies that the Sentinel-2 method detects in average 78 % of the trucks counted at the station (Fig. 3).

Since the station data is hourly, its mean per 15 minutes was calculated for the date and time of the respective Sentinel-2 acquisition. It is important to note that the validation is still limited to Germany and only to motorways. Furthermore, on large scale processing, an area-specific uncertainty is introduced by haze that may lead to false detections. This uncertainty tends to be higher in smaller areas of interest with generally low truck traffic.
