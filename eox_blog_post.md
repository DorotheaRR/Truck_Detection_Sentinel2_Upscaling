## Sentinel-2 truck detection - upscaling

Can we detect moving trucks using Sentinel-2 data? Normally, targeting objects of this size at 10 m resolution does not seem promising. Still, one of the participants of the [Euro Data Cube COVID-19 Custom Script Contest](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/contest-covid/) presented a method that enables to detect moving trucks with Sentinel-2 data. 

HOW POSSIBLE??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????


In the Euro Data Cube session at ESA EO Phi-Week he is going to present his work upscaling the Sentinel-2 truck detection to the area of the European Union. 

Join the ESA EO Phi-Week side event 'Euro Data Cube - Furnishing the “EO Workplace” with Data and Tools for Effectiveness and Production' on Thursday, 1st of October, from 11.30 AM.
