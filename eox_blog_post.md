## Sentinel-2 truck detection - upscaling

Can we detect moving trucks using Sentinel-2 data? Normally, targeting objects of this size at 10 m resolution does not seem promising. Still, Henrik Fisser, Master's student at the University of Würzburg, presented a method that enables to detect moving trucks with Sentinel-2 data and won the [Euro Data Cube COVID-19 Custom Script Contest](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/contest-covid/) with this contribution. The method exploits an effect of the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) that sees moving objects once per spectral band at slightly different times. Due to this effect objects of sufficient size appear spectrally disassembled in the data, which makes them detectable based on the unusual spectral signature. 
After having proven the concept, Henrik Fisser scaled up the truck detection to the area of the whole European Union for integration into the [Rapid Action on Coronavirus and EO (RACE)](https://race.esa.int/) dashboard. From 


In the Euro Data Cube session at ESA EO Phi-Week he is going to present his work upscaling the Sentinel-2 truck detection to the area of the European Union. 

Join the ESA EO Phi-Week side event 'Euro Data Cube - Furnishing the “EO Workplace” with Data and Tools for Effectiveness and Production' on Thursday, 1st of October, from 11.30 AM.
